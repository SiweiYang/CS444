<h2>Additional requirements for students taking CS644</h2>

Students enrolled in CS644 are required to carry out a literature survey related to any specific area of compiler construction.
A survey should include a minimum of 3 papers that the student has carefully read. The student should summarize and explain
the papers in a coherent and organized way. At least 1/3 of the survey should address the student's personal views on the topic
including, but not limited to, discussing the contributions and limitations of the literature surveyed.
<p>
Each student is required to meet the instructor at least once by February 14th, 2014
to discuss a topic of interest. A meeting can be scheduled 
by emailing the instructor directly. It is recommended that the student 
performs some preliminary search of a topic of interest before attending 
the meeting.

<ul>
    <li> Motivation (why is this interesting?)

</ul>

using the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM Proceedings format.</a>
