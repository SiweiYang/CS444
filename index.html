    <dt>Course Description and Objectives:</dt> <dd>
The objective of the course is to provide a thorough understanding
of the basic structure of compilers for Java-like languages. A major
part of the course consists of the implementation of a compiler for a
simplified Java-like language. The goal of the course is to acquaint
students with software tools and techniques which are applicable both
to compilers and the implementation of system utility routines, command
interpreters, etc.
    </dd>
    <dt>Topics covered:</dt> <dd>
scanning, parsing, abstract syntax trees, scoping and name resolution, type checking, static analysis, runtime organization, code generation.
    </dd>

<h2>Course Project</h2>

The overall project for the course is to write a compiler from <a
href="joos.html">Joos 1W</a>, a fairly large subset of Java, to
i386 assembly language (the <a href="http://www.nasm.us">Netwide
Assembler</a> dialect). The project will be done in groups of
three. The project will be broken up into several assignments
with fixed due dates. The assignments must be submitted to the <a
href="https://marmoset.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/">Marmoset</a> on-line submission
and testing system. For each assignment, you will submit
both your code and a written report (for assignments 1, 4, and 5) to Marmoset.
Marks for your code will be reported to you by Marmoset, and your
marked written reports will be returned to you by e-mail.

<ul>
    <li><a href="a0.html">Assignment 0: Choosing a group</a> (0%) due Tuesday, January 14, 2014 at 11:59 pm
    <li><a href="a1.html">Assignment 1: Scanning, Parsing, Weeding, AST Building</a> (13%) due Friday, February 7, 2014 at 11:59 pm
    <li><a href="a2.html">Assignment 2: Name Resolution</a> (9%) due Wednesday, March 5, 2014 at 11:59 pm
    <li><a href="a3.html">Assignment 3: Type Checking</a> (9%) due Friday, March 14, 2014 at 11:59 pm
    <li><a href="a4.html">Assignment 4: Static Analysis</a> (6%) due Friday, March 21, 2014 at 11:59 pm
    <li><a href="a5.html">Assignment 5: Code Generation</a> (13%) due Friday, April 4, 2014 at 11:59 pm
</ul>

The above assignment marks total 50% of your final mark. An additional 10%
will be assigned to secret tests which will be run after
the assignment 5 deadline.
<p>
Students enrolled in CS 644 are required to complete 
<a href="644.shtml">a literature survey on a topic related to compiler construction.</a>

<h2>Resources available in the <tt>linux.student.cs</tt> environment.</h2>
<ul>
<li> Test cases used by Marmoset to test your assignment submissions
can be found in <tt>/u/cs444/pub/assignment_testcases</tt>. Use these
testcases to test your solutions and before submitting to Marmoset.
<li> For this course, a minimalist version of the
Java standard library is provided. The library versions for each assignment can be found
in the <tt>linux.student.cs</tt> environment in the directory
<tt>/u/cs444/pub/stdlib/</tt>. On assignment 2 and later assignments, Marmoset will include all
files in this library on the <tt>joosc</tt> command line for
every test, in addition to other source file(s) specific to that
test. The following versioning scheme is used to make it possible
to correct errors and/or to extend the library for future assignments
(although we aim to minimize the number of changes that will be required).
The 3 in the directory name refers to Assignment 3, and the 0
is the first version of the library. Any corrections to the Assignment 3
version of the library will appear in the directories <tt>3.1</tt>,
<tt>3.2</tt>, etc., and the version of the library for Assignment 4
will appear in the directory <tt>4.0</tt>.
Currently all the stdlib versions are the same.

</ul>


<h2>Group Work Marking Policy</h2>

When working in a group, disagreements sometimes arise. One of the
objectives of this course is for you to resolve such disagreements
with sufficient, constructive, and frank communication within the group.
Therefore, when disagreements arise, discuss them within the group
before asking the instructor to intervene. If
the group fails to reach a resolution, the group as a whole should
arrange a meeting with the instructor. The instructor's
role is primarily to mediate the discussion within the group, rather
than to intervene in the disagreement.
<p>
Problems are easier to resolve if handled early. When a problem arises,
try to resolve it as soon as possible. Do not leave it until
the end of the course.
<p>
At the end of the course, the following policies will be used to
distribute marks among the group members:
<ol>
    <li>Normally, each member of the group will be given an equal
    mark. You should therefore strive to ensure that each group
    member makes an approximately equal contribution to the project.
    <li>The group may propose a different distribution of the marks,
    provided all group members consent to the distribution. Such a
    proposal must be made to the instructor within three days after
    the due date of the last assignment. The marks will be distributed
    in such a way that the mean of the marks equals the original group
    mark and no individual project mark exceeds 100%.
    <li>If agreement cannot be reached, a member of the group must
    contact the instructor within three days of the due date of
    the last assignment. The instructor will ask each group member
    to submit a written statement detailing the contributions of
    each group member, the nature of the conflict, and the steps
    that were taken by the group to resolve the conflict. Failure
    to submit the statement within three days of being asked to
    do so will result in a mark of zero for that group member.
    Based on the statements, the instructor will make a final
    decision about the mark distribution. Note that the instructor
    will generally not deviate from the equal distribution of marks
    unless convinced that the group took sufficient and timely steps
    to resolve the conflict internally.
</ol>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>
The written report for each assignment <b>must</b> be submitted by the
assignment deadline. Reports submitted after the deadline will not be
marked and will receive a mark of <b>zero</b>. If you cannot finish an
assignment by the deadline, submit what you have by the deadline,
and explain any unfinished parts in your report.
<p>
For code submissions, the following late policy is in effect: <b>(0.5 * best-on-time) + (0.5 * best-overall)</b>, where<br>
<ul>
 <li>best-on-time: is the best submission within the assignment deadline</li>
 <li>best-overall: is the best overall submission up until 11:59pm, Friday, April 4, 2014.
</ul>
Examples:
<ul>
  <li> Group gets 90% marks on a January 10th submission of Assignment 1 and there is no submission after the deadline.<br>
       Mark: (0.5 * 90%) + (0.5 * 90%) = 90%</li>
  <li> Group gets 50% marks on a January 10th submission of Assignment 1 and 90% on a February 20th re-submission of Assignment 1.<br>
       Mark: (0.5 * 50%) + (0.5 * 90%) = 70%</li>
 <li>  Group gets 90% marks on a February 20th submission of Assignment 1.<br>
       Mark: (0.5 * 0%) + (0.5 * 90%) = 45%</li>
</ul>
Submitting an additional solution for an assignment can never reduce your mark.

<h2>Academic Integrity Policies</h2>
<!-- This statement is meant to be included (ie, via SSI) inside of a complete
     HTML document.  It should *not* be linked to as a standalone page.  
-->

<div id="academic_integrity_statement">

   <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
   <p>In order to maintain a culture of academic
   integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected
   to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.
   Check the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">Office of
   Academic Integrity's website</a> for more information.</p>

   <p>All members of the UW community are expected to hold to the highest standard
   of academic integrity in their studies, teaching, and research.
   This site explains why academic integrity is important and how students
   can avoid academic misconduct. It also identifies resources available on
   campus for students and faculty to help achieve academic integrity in &mdash; and
   out &mdash; of the classroom.</p>

   <h3>Grievance</h3>
   <p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some
   aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may
   have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read 
   <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm">
      Policy 70 &mdash; Student Petitions and Grievances</a>, Section 4.  
   When in doubt please be certain to contact the department's administrative
   assistant who will provide further assistance. </p>

   <h3>Discipline</h3>
   <p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic
   integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take
   responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an
   action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to
   avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group
   work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor,
   academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean.  For information on
   categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should refer to
   <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm">
   Policy 71 &mdash; Student Discipline</a>.  For typical penalties, check
   <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm">
   Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.
   </p>

   <h3>Avoiding Academic Offenses</h3>
   <p>Most students are unaware of the line between acceptable and
   unacceptable academic behaviour, especially when discussing assignments
   with classmates and using the work of other students.  For information
   on commonly misunderstood academic offenses and how to avoid them,
   students should refer to the
   <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/Current/cheating_policy.shtml">
      Faculty of Mathematics Cheating and Student
      Academic Discipline Policy</a>.
   </p>

   <h3>Appeals</h3>
   <p>A decision made or a penalty imposed under Policy 70, Student Petitions
   and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71, Student Discipline may
   be appealed if there is a ground.  A student who believes he/she has a 
   ground for an appeal should refer to
   <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm">
      Policy 72 &mdash; Student Appeals</a>.
   </p>

   <h3>Note for students with disabilities</h3>
   <p><a
   href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> 
   (formerly the Office for Persons with Disabilities or OPD), 
   located in Needles Hall, Room 1132,
   collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate
   accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the
   academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations
   to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the
   beginning of each academic term.</p>
