CS 444/644 - Compiler Construction (Winter 2014) - Assignment 0
</h1>

<h2>Choosing a group</h2>

The overall project for the course is to write a compiler from <a
href="joos.html">Joos 1W</a>, a fairly large subset of Java, to
i386 assembly language (the <a href="http://www.nasm.us">Netwide
Assembler</a> dialect). The project will be done in groups of
three. The project will be broken up into several assignments
with fixed due dates. The assignments must be submitted to the <a
href="https://marmoset.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/">Marmoset</a> on-line submission
and testing system. For each assignment, you will submit
both your code and a written report to Marmoset.
<p>
The project may be done in any programming language of your choice,
as long as it can be practically installed in the linux.student.cs
environment. If your language of choice cannot be installed,
you may have to choose an alternative language.
<p>
One of the goals of the course is for you to understand how compilers
and compiler generation tools work, rather than relying on them as
myserious black boxes. Therefore, your compiler must use only code that
you wrote or that is provided to you by the instructor. Your compiler
may use machine-generated code, as long as the code that generated it
was written by you or by the instructor. You may not use code obtained
from elsewhere or code generated by code obtained from elsewhere;
in particular, you may not use generators such as lex or yacc. You
may not use external libraries obtained from elsewhere. You may use the
standard library that comes as part of the programming language that you
choose to use. However, you may not use any scanner or parser generator
that may be included in the standard library of your language of choice.
If you have any doubts about which code you may or may not use, please
ask the instructor for clarification.
<p>
Each group <b>must</b> use some revision control system such as CVS,
Subversion, git, etc.
<p>
For assignment 0, do the following tasks:
<ul>
    <li>Choose a group of three.
    <li>Agree on an implementation language, and determine whether
    it is already available on the linux.student.cs environment, or if
    it is easy for you to install yourself. For example, many
    languages come with a compiler written in Java that translates 
    to Java bytecode.
    <li>Agree on an revision control system that you will use.
    If it is not already available in the linux.student.cs environment,
    install it in your own account.
    <li>Send an e-mail to cs444@student.cs with the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>Names and Unix userids of the members of the group
        <li>The programming language that you would like to use, and
        whether or not it is already available in the linux.student.cs
        environment. If you installed it yourself, include detailed
        instructions on how you did so.
        <li>The revision control system that you plan to use.
    </ul>
</ul>
