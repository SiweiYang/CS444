2014</h1>
A .cfg file is a text file representing a context-free grammar.
<h3>Context-free Grammar Representation</h3>
The context-free grammar representation has four components, in order:
<ul>
<li><i>t</i>, a positive integer giving the number of terminal symbols in the grammar, followed
by <i>t</i> lines, each containing the name of a distinct terminal symbol.  Each terminal symbol may
be any string of one or more printable ascii characters, excluding white space.
</li><li><i>n</i>, a positive integer giving the number of nonterminal symbols in the grammar, followed
by <i>n</i> lines, each containing the name of a distinct nonterminal symbol.  Each nonterminal
symbol may be any string of one or more printable ascii characters, and must not be the same as any terminal symbol.
</li><li>A single line giving the name of the start symbol, which must be one of the nonterminal symbols
</li><li><i>r</i>, a positive integer giving the number of production rules in the grammar, followed by <i>r</i> lines, each denoting a rule consisting of:
<ul><li>The left-hand-side (LHS) of the rule; a nonterminal symbol
</li><li>The right-hand-side (RHS) of the rule; zero or more terminal
or nonterminal symbols separated from each other, and from the LHS by a
single space
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
